# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

## Overview

This repository implements Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm, a technique in data mining for discovering associations between items purchased together. The goal is to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transaction data.

## Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm works by iteratively discovering frequent itemsets and generating association rules based on user-defined thresholds. It's a fundamental approach for uncovering patterns in transactional data.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a dataset of transactions. The dataset structure and any preprocessing steps are detailed to provide insights into the data used for association rule mining.

## Results

The results section highlights key findings and insights obtained from the Market Basket Analysis. It may include interesting associations discovered and visualizations for better understanding.
